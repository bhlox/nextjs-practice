## Lessons Learned

Initially this projects was supposed to be a practice for my next JS learning.
as I progressed, I want to implement such features that I haven't came across 
the videos I've been learning from YT and udemy.

To keep things shorts, I learned how databases operate. how the difference of a small project and this project made.
Naming states and files was also a tough choice in the process. I still have yet to manage my cleanliness
and organization when it comes to files.
